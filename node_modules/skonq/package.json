  "readme": "skonq is intended to be a lightweight library for queuing functions.  This was born out of laziness - so it's very basic and simple to use.  I didn't need 95% of the functionality in ASYNC or STEP and I don't like the syntax for queuing functions with those so this was created, if you need more functionality then check out those 2 great libraries.\r\n\r\nUsing SKONQ\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFrom your project directory:\r\n```bash\r\n    $ npm install skonq\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin your application:\r\n```javascript\r\n    var nq = require(\"skonq\");\r\n    \r\n    var somefunction = function(){ \r\n        /* do some stuff here */\r\n        nq.next();\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    nq.nq(somefunction, somefunctionsargs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this All?\r\n------------\r\nLong answer: yes, what more do you need?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
